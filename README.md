Hi, Iâ€™m @EdCallahan. I am the Data Services Lead in Winona State University. That job has evolved over the years, I started out embedded in our Institutional Research 
department and generating official statistics, statistical analysis, enrollment projections and generating raw datasets and reports to assist both Administration's needs but also to keep 
operational departments operating (Admissions, Housing, Advising, etc).  I wrote a lot of SQL, wrote SSRS reports and PowerBI reports in this stage.

I've retained some of that work supporting operations, and I've now added handing a lot of data integrations between systems. I use a lot of PowerShell these days, and
interact with a lot of web services. I've inherited data integrations from the Minnesota State System Student Record system into Dynamics CRM, and am now pretty dedicated
in implementing a replacement integration into Salesforce.

I also backup our DBA at Winona State and have deal with Replication and Service Broker on the MS SQL Platform.

I live in the Driftless Region along the Upper Mississippi in Wisconsin. I ride and tour on motorcycles (Triumph Bonneville and a Suzuki V-Strom), take a lot of pictures 
(now with my Olympus E-M5II) and bake a lot of bread.
